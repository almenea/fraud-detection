= Automating workflows with data science pipelines

[role="_abstract"]
Earlier, you used a notebook to train and save your model. Optionally, you can automate these tasks by using {productname-long} pipelines. Pipelines offer a way to automate the execution of many notebooks and Python code. By using pipelines, you can run long training jobs or retrain your models on a schedule without having to manually run them in a notebook.

To explore the pipeline editor, complete the steps in the following procedures to create your own pipeline. 

Alternately, you can skip the following procedures and instead run the `6 Train Save.pipeline` file.
