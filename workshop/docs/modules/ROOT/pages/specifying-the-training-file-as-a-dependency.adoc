= Specifying the training file as a dependency

[role="_abstract"]
Set node properties in your pipeline to specify the training file as a dependency.

NOTE: If you do not set this file dependency, the file is not included in the node when it runs and the training job fails.

.Prerequisites

* You added two nodes to your pipeline as described in xref:adding-nodes-to-your-pipeline.adoc[Adding nodes to your pipeline].

.Procedure

. Click the `1_experiment_train.ipynb` node.

. Scroll down to the *File Dependencies* section and then click *Add*.

. Set the value to `data/*.csv` which has the data to train your model.

. Select the *Include Subdirectories* option.
