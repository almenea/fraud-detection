= Creating a pipeline

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a simple pipeline by using the GUI pipeline editor. The pipeline uses the notebook that you used earlier to train a model and then save it to S3 storage.

.Prerequisites

* You configured a pipeline server as described in xref:enabling-data-science-pipelines.adoc[Enabling data science pipelines].
* If you configured the pipeline server after you created your workbench, you stopped and then started your workbench.

.Procedure

. Open your workbench's JupyterLab environment. If the launcher is not visible, click *+* to open it.

You have created a blank pipeline.

. Set the default runtime image for when you run your notebook or Python code.

.. In the pipeline editor, click *Open Panel*.
