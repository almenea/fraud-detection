= Deploying a  model

[role="_abstract"]
Given that the model is accessible in storage and saved in the portable ONNX format, you can use an {productname-short} model server to deploy it as an API.

{productname-short} offers two options for model serving: 		

* *Single-model serving* - Each model in the project deploys on its own model server. This platform works well for large models or models that need dedicated resources.
* *Multi-model serving* - All models in the project deploy on the same model server. This platform is suitable for sharing resources among deployed models. Multi-model serving is the only option offered in the {org-name} Developer Sandbox environment.

For this {deliverable}, because you are deploying only one model, you can select either serving type. The steps for deploying the fraud detection model depend on the type of model serving platform that you select:
