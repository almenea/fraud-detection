[role="_abstract"]
Earlier, you trained the fraud detection model directly in a notebook and then in a pipeline. You can also distribute the training of a machine learning model across many CPUs.

Distributing training is not necessary for a simple model. However, by applying it to the example fraud model, you learn how to train more complex models that require more compute power.

You can try one or both of the following options:

* The Ray distributed computing framework, as described in
xref:distributing-training-jobs-with-ray.adoc[Distributing training jobs with Ray].

* The Training Operator, as described in 
xref:distributing-training-jobs-with-kfto.adoc[Distributing training jobs with the Training Operator].
